# 📈 Stock Sentiment-Aware Price Forecasting using LLM + MLStack

A hybrid machine learning system that estimates future stock prices by combining real-time textual financial sentiment (news, Twitter, etc.) and traditional market indicators. The system leverages LLMs like **FinBERT**, custom embeddings, and regression-based predictors, and is built with a full MLOps pipeline on **Chameleon Cloud**.

## 🧠 Value Proposition

Traditional trading systems underutilize unstructured sentiment data. This project enhances stock prediction accuracy by integrating sentiment analysis with financial time-series data, helping analysts and decision-makers make better-informed predictions.

- **Current Status Quo**: Manual lookup or rule-based signal processing
- **Our Improvement**: ML-enhanced predictions using structured + unstructured data
- **Business Metric**: Accuracy of predictions, latency for inference, real-time adaptability

## 🛠️ Project Design

### 🧠 Model Training

- Fine-tuning FinBERT + sentiment embeddings
- Market embeddings from structured data
- Combined model via Logistic Regression or XGBoost
- Tracked in **MLflow**, scheduled via **Ray**
- ✅ **Difficulty**: Distributed training (Ray Train), Ray Tune HPO

### 🚀 Model Serving & Monitoring

- FastAPI Docker app for `/predict`
- Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
- ✅ **Difficulty**: Compare CPU/GPU inference + live drift monitoring

### 🔄 Data Pipeline

- **Offline**: Twitter/YFinance → ETL → Postgres
- **Online**: Simulated API calls for real-time update
- ✅ **Difficulty**: Interactive data quality dashboard

### 🔁 Continuous Integration

- CI/CD via GitHub Actions:
  - ETL → Train → Evaluate → Docker Build → Helm Deploy
- Staging/Canary/Prod with Helm

## 📊 Evaluation Plan

- Offline evaluation: BLEU, MAPE, MAE on held-out test set
- Online evaluation: User simulation tests
- Drift detection: Based on embeddings, market data change
- Feedback loop: Real-time prediction storage for retraining
